<p align='center'> As we can read from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate'> Wikipedia</a> , <strong> The churn rate </strong> in a most basic form is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support.<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_rate' > [1] </a></p>
<br>
<p align='center'>
When it comes to <strong>customer churn</strong> infrastructures like <strong>banks, telephone service companies, internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services</strong> often use customer churn rates analysis as one of their key business metrics, because the cost of <strong> retaining an existing customer </strong> is far less than <strong>acquiring a new one.</strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition' > [2] </a>
</p>
<br>
<p align='center'>
In the business context, <strong>churn</strong> refers both to <strong>customers migration,</strong> but also to their <strong>loss of value.</strong> <strong>Churn rate</strong> refers, on the one hand, to the <strong>percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization</strong>,but on the other hand, to the customers who <strong>still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to</strong>. Current organizations face therefore a <strong>huge challenge</strong>.
The ability to anticipate to customers abandon in order to retain them results in <strong>gaining efficiency and competitivity</strong> in the market.There are <strong>advanced analytics tools and applications</strong>, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of <strong>data</strong> inside the organizations to make <strong>predictions</strong> based on the information obtained from <strong>analyzing and exploring those data.</strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition' > [2] </a> </p>
